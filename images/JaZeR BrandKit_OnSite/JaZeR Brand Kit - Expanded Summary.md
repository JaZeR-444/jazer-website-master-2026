JaZeR Brand Kit - Expanded Summary
Vision and identity

Vibe. Neon energy with cosmic sci fi flavor. Centered on purples, blues, pinks, and golds on dark backdrops.

Story pillars. Portal symbolism, starbursts, mandalas, mythic jellyfish deity, rain-on-asphalt reflections, and circuit motifs.

Use case priorities. Thumbnails and social headers first, streaming cover art second, merch later.

Accessibility quick picks

Use Graphite on Stardust White for light mode screens.

Avoid Neon Pink or Sunburst Gold for long body copy. Use them for highlights and short labels.

Typography

Headlines. Orbitron. Bold for H1. Medium for H2 and H3.

Body. Montserrat. Regular and SemiBold.

Fallbacks. Arial or Helvetica for body. Trebuchet MS for headings if Orbitron is missing.

Tracking. Slightly open letter spacing on large neon headlines by 2 to 4 percent.

Glow. Use a thin outer glow on dark backgrounds for contrast and depth. Keep blur subtle.

Logo system and usage

Delivered marks. Primary colorful wordmark as PNG with transparency and SVG vector.

Clear space. Keep at least the height of the letter J around all sides.

Minimum size. 160 px width on screens. 30 mm width in print.

Background control. Use a thin dark outline or neon stroke when sitting on complex imagery.

Do not. Stretch, change the approved colors, stack filters, or place on low contrast areas without an outline.

Future variants to add

Single color logo in white and Graphite for merch and emboss.

Icon only version using the J or a simple starburst for circular avatars.

Horizontal and vertical lockups for headers and square tiles.

Imagery and motion

Imagery recipe. Night cityscapes after rain, long exposure light trails, cosmic dust fields, polygonal starbursts, and circuit traces.

Treatment. Vignette to center focus. Light grain for texture. Optional chromatic aberration at 1 to 2 percent.

Motion idea. Slow parallax of starfields, pulsing outline glow synced to track BPM, and vertical portal flares during drops.

Social and platform sizes

YouTube thumbnail. 1280 x 720. Keep title in center 80 percent width.

YouTube channel art. 2560 x 1440. Safe area 1546 x 423 centered.

Instagram story or reel. 1080 x 1920. Keep important text within 1080 x 1420 center.

X header. 1500 x 500. Keep content left aligned to avoid avatar overlay.
