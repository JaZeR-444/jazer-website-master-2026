- Body. 18 to 20 px

Tracking and effects.
- Slightly increase letter spacing on large neon headlines. 2 to 4 percent.
- Optional outer glow. 2 to 4 px blur. Use the palette color of the text.

## Logo Usage

Clear space.
- Keep padding equal to the height of the letter J around the logo on all sides.

Minimum sizes.
- Digital. 160 px width minimum.
- Print. 30 mm width minimum.

Backgrounds.
- Use light or dark versions for maximum contrast.
- On busy imagery, add a thin neon outline or glow that matches one of the primary colors.

Do not.
- Do not skew or stretch.
- Do not recolor outside the approved palette.
- Do not add drop shadows that fight with the glow aesthetic.
- Do not place on low contrast or patterned backgrounds without an outline.

## Templates

Create and store the following in `Templates/`.

- **YouTube Thumbnail**. 1280 x 720. Center-safe text. Use Electric Purple or Cosmic Blue gradient with Neon Pink or Gold accent.

## Imagery Style and Motifs

- Cosmic portals, neon starbursts, mandalas, and mythic jellyfish deities.
- Long exposure light trails, sci fi silhouettes, night city reflections after rain.
- Keep the energy high with purples, blues, pinks, and gold accents.
- Use vignette or radial glow to draw focus to the subject.
- Grain and chromatic aberration can be used lightly for texture.

## Iconography and Graphic Elements

- Rounded neon lines, orbit paths, microchip traces, and constellation dots.
- Symbols for power, infinity, stars, and masks.
- Use 2 px line thickness on most UI icons. 3 px for hero symbols.

## Best Practices

1. Keep master files. Do not delete original editable versions.
2. Export multiple formats. PNG for transparency. SVG for vectors. JPG for compressed art. AI or PSD for source files.
3. Document everything. Log changes to colors, logos, and templates in this file.
4. Version control. Update the version string at the top when changes are made.
5. Share widely. Give your collaborators read access and keep this file pinned.
