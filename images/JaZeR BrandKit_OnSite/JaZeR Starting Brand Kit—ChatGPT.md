You want a concise recap of our work in this thread, centered on deliverables, with download links grouped at the end, plus code snippets and future tips.



Summary of Main Points

Highlights and decisions



Brand focus confirmed. Neon energy with purples, blues, pinks, and gold accents.



Core assets produced. Primary logo as transparent PNG and editable SVG. Brand kit compiled as Markdown and exported to PDF.



Typography direction. Orbitron for headlines, Montserrat for body. Common fallbacks noted for quick use.



Style cues. Cosmic portals, starbursts, mandalas, and mythic jellyfish visuals. High contrast on dark fields with soft glow.



Core brand elements



Primary palette

Electric Purple #8B5CF6. Cosmic Blue #3B82F6. Neon Pink #EC4899. Sunburst Gold #F59E0B.

Aether Teal #06B6D4. Ultraviolet #A78BFA. Neutrals: Night Black #0B0E12. Stardust White #F8F9FF.

Utility neutrals: Graphite #1F2937. Soft Slate #94A3B8.



Typography

Orbitron for H1 to H3. Montserrat for body and UI. Fallbacks include Arial, Helvetica, and Trebuchet MS.



Logo usage rules

Clear space equal to the J height. Minimum width 160 px digital. Use light or dark versions for contrast. On busy art add a thin outline or glow. Do not skew, recolor outside the palette, or apply heavy drop shadows.



Imagery and motifs

Night city reflections, long exposure light trails, cosmic scenes, and techno mysticism. Keep the center focus with a radial glow or vignette.



Templates to create next

YouTube thumbnail 1280x720. Channel art 2560x1440 with safe area. Instagram post 1080x1080. Story or Reel 1080x1920. X header 1500x500. Email signature at 600 px width.

Things to consider next



Font handling in Canva. The SVG keeps live text. If Canva substitutes fonts, upload Orbitron and Montserrat or outline the text before final export.



Contrast checks. Ensure body text meets WCAG contrast on Night Black. Use Stardust White or Soft Slate for long copy.



Glow restraint. Keep glow at 2 to 4 px blur for legibility. Increase only for large hero art.



Single color marks. Prepare white and graphite versions for emboss, laser, or merch printing.



Print workflows. CMYK values in the kit are calculated. Ask your print shop for their profile and soft proof before large runs.



Versioning. Add a version number in the brand kit. Log changes to colors, logos, and templates.

Confidence 97%. The summary matches our thread and the links point to generated local files. Minor uncertainty lies in how Canva renders the SVG if fonts are not uploaded, and in CMYK variations across printers.
